# Elasticity Configuration for Demand Simulator
# ==================================================
# This file defines price elasticity parameters and demand modifiers
# used by the behavioral demand simulator for ML training data generation.
#
# Elasticity values are negative (law of demand):
# - More negative = more elastic (higher price sensitivity)
# - Less negative = less elastic (lower price sensitivity)
#
# Key naming: {location}_{period}_{vehicle_type}
# - Location: Urban, Suburban, Rural
# - Period: Peak (Evening/Morning), Standard (Afternoon/Night)
# - Vehicle Type: Premium, Economy

# Price elasticity by segment
# Premium customers are generally less price-sensitive than Economy
elasticity:
  # Urban segments (highest density, most options)
  Urban_Peak_Premium: -0.7      # Premium users during peak - least elastic
  Urban_Peak_Economy: -1.0      # Economy users during peak
  Urban_Standard_Premium: -0.8  # Premium users off-peak
  Urban_Standard_Economy: -1.2  # Economy users off-peak
  
  # Suburban segments (moderate density)
  Suburban_Peak_Premium: -0.9
  Suburban_Peak_Economy: -1.1
  Suburban_Standard_Premium: -1.0
  Suburban_Standard_Economy: -1.3
  
  # Rural segments (low density, fewer alternatives)
  Rural_Peak_Premium: -1.0
  Rural_Peak_Economy: -1.2
  Rural_Standard_Premium: -1.1
  Rural_Standard_Economy: -1.5  # Most elastic - price sensitive with few options

# Demand modifiers (multiplicative factors applied to base demand)
modifiers:
  # Time of day effects on demand
  # Higher values = higher demand
  time:
    Morning: 0.9      # Morning commute - moderate demand
    Afternoon: 0.85   # Midday lull - lower demand
    Evening: 1.1      # Peak demand - commute + social
    Night: 0.7        # Late night - lowest demand
  
  # Loyalty tier effects on purchase probability
  # Higher tiers = more likely to convert (higher loyalty = trust)
  loyalty:
    Bronze: 1.0       # Baseline
    Silver: 1.05      # 5% more likely
    Gold: 1.1         # 10% more likely
    Platinum: 1.15    # 15% more likely

# Reference price sensitivity (anchoring effect)
# How much price deviation from historical cost affects demand
# Higher value = stronger anchoring effect
reference_price_sensitivity: 0.3

# Base demand (starting probability before modifiers)
base_demand: 0.5
