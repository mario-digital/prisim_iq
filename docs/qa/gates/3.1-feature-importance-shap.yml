    status: PASS
    notes: 'Internal ML processing only, no user input validation concerns. SHAP values derived from model internals.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Lazy SHAP explainer initialization prevents unnecessary computation. Efficient numpy operations for normalization.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Edge cases handled: all-zero coefficients, missing background data raises ValueError, invalid model types rejected.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns (calculator, explainer, service). Comprehensive type hints and docstrings. 40 unit tests with clear AC mapping.'
